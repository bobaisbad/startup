# Get With Friends

[My Notes](notes.md)

An application that allows friends, compadres, and/or work buddies to schedule times together to meet, work, hangout, eat together, or whatever else they want to do together. Utilises a shared calendar experience only accessible by those who have an account associated with the specified calendar to keep the privacy of the friend/work group.


<!-- > [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item. -->

### Elevator pitch

Ever been part of a friend group, work team, animation cohort, or community group and have struggled to schedule a good time to get together, whether it be for eating, hanging out, working, animating, having fun, or serving? Get With Friends allows you to facilitate this often complex task by allowing realtime updates to a group calendar where anyone in the group can put down events, meetings, get togethers, etc. and allow others to react and RSVP simply and quickly. Simple, fast, and collaborative.

    - login
    - registration
    - calendar retrieval
    - calendar event info retrieval
    - update calendar/event(s) (add, update, delete, suggest, react, etc.)
